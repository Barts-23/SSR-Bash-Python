About the QR code generation process is installed via pip [third-party software package](https://github.com/lincolnloop/python-qrcode)ÔºåGenerated by third-party software locally on the server, the generated QR code link will also be automatically destroyed without uploading any information. Your IP is blocked, or your server has an abnormally high load, which has nothing to do with the script itself.
